      In computer history, one name often goes unnoticed, overshadowed by more prominent figures like *AlanTuring and *Charles Babbage. 
      Tommy Flowers but he is one of the greatest heroes of World War Two. 
      Although he never joined the battlefield, Tommy Flowers used his invention to save many thousands of lives. 
      Tommy Flowers is one of histories most significant electrical engineers. His work on the first programmable computer, 
      Colossus, has sealed his place in history.
      Tommy Flowers played a important role in shaping the digital landscape we know today.
        <br>
        <br>
    Flowers's creative thinking pushed the boundaries of what was possible at the time. 
    FFrom his impressive work during World War Two, the construction of the first programmable electronic computer, 
    Flowers left an indelible mark on history, revolutionizing technology in ways that continue to shape our lives.
       <br>
       <br>
    However Flowers's impact on history had more than the realm of technology. 
    His contributions during World War Two helped shape the course of the conflict and influenced the outcome.

      <h1>Early years</h1>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">
         <h3>Tommy Flowers was born and raised in London’s East
         End working-class neighborhood. After taking an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering at the Royal Arsenal, he studied engineering part-time, graduating from London University in 1933. 
         <br>
         <br>
             In 1926 Flowers found a job
             in the telecommunication branch of the General Post Office (GPO), then responsible for the telephone system as an electrical engineer and four years l
             ater transferred to the Post Office Research Station, where he worked on switching technologies. In the late 1930s, Tommy Flowers had considerable experience
              and knowledge in the use of valves, especially in developing systems of valve amplifiers and switches that, by 1939, enabled long-distance calls to be made without an operator.

      <h1>WW2 work</h1>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <h3>During the Battle of Britain, Flowers was working with Fighter Command on radar. 
          In 1941, he was sent to help the code breakers, particularly mathematical genius Alan Turing, at the Government Code and Cypher School 
          at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire. Flowers built an electromechanical device using high-speed rotary switches to crack the German Enigma 
          code, 
          but it was superseded by coding developments.
          <br>
          <br>
          He worked with *Max Newman on the *‘Heath Robinson’ e
          lectro-mechanical machine, the shortcomings of it led 
          him and his team to build an all-electronic machine. 
          it was made of old telephone circuitry, it contained 1,800 thermionic valves
          <br>
          <br>
          To avoid the issue of valve failure frequently caused by 
          heating and cooling, Flowers used a simple way that never turns the machine off. Named Colossus,
          it was successfully demonstrated in December 1943.
          Following its transfer to Bletchley Park, within a fortnight it had been used to decipher the most complicated German codes, 
          nicknamed "Fish" and "Tunny".

      <h3>It is a set of computers designed by British codebreakers between 1943 to 1945. 
          It is used to help in the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher (It was a process that helped the British to read German army messages
          during World War). Colossus used thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) to perform Boolean
          (Boolean algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with operations on logical values with binary variables.) 
          and counting operations. Colossus is thus regarded as the world's first programmable, electronic, digital computer.

      <h1>Unsung Hero</h1>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <h3>For many years, Flowers was largely unsung for his impressive war work and key role in the development of the modern computer, 
          due to the secrecy surrounding Bletchley Park. However, he knew that he had produced a truly innovative machine.
          Many years later, he said: ‘Colossus bore about as much resemblance to a modern computer as Stephenson’s Rocket locomotive did to the 
          Royal Scot, but it embodied all the basic features.’

      <h1>A legacy in code-breaking and computer tech</h1>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <h3>Flowers passed away on October 28, 1998, but left behind a legacy that included not only Britain’s codebreaking 
          efforts but the technology behind the MOSAIC computer built between 1947 and 1953 at London Underground station,
          Dollis Hill. Recognition came late for Flowers—an honorary doctoral degree from Newcastle University in 1976 and the inaugural Martlesham Medal in 1980.
